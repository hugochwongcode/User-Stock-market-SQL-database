# User Stock Financial SQL Database
Welcome to the User and Stock market SQL Database Project! This project is designed to showcase my skills in SQL, data analysis, and database design. The project covers a range of financial scenarios, from tracking stock financial performance data to user transactions and earnings analysis. 

## Description
The Stock Market and User Database is a PostgreSQL-based project that integrates user and stock market data for comprehensive analysis. This system is expected to allow users to register, log in, and perform transactions. User activities are collected, and subsequent analysis aims to determine if these activities are dependent on stock market data, such as earnings, market cap, and ranking. 

## Database Schema
The database schema illustrates the structure and relationships between the Stock Market and User databases. 
It includes the following tables:
- Companies
- Stocks
- Transactions
- StockPrices
- Earnings
- Users
- UserTransactions
- UserStocks
- UserCompanies
- StockEarnings

## Queries
A variety of SQL queries have been created, including 
1. Retrieve information from stocks, users and their activities
2. Calculation of changes in stocks, user's transactions, Return of Investment (ROI)
3. Identify gainers, losers and ranking 
4. Analyze user behavior upon their transaction and stock financial performance like earnings, revenue, ranking

## Usage
1. **Database Setup:**
   - Ensure you have a SQL database management system installed, like MySQL, PostgreSQL and client tool like MySQL Workbench and pgAdmin4
   - Create a new database in client tool 
   - Download all the SQL queries files
   - Start the client tool 
   - Open the (`UserStocksqlproject_CreateTables.sql`) file
   - Execute to create the necessary tables within your database
  
2. **Query Execution:**
   - Download all the remaining SQL queries file 
   - Review the SQL queries to understand the analysis scenarios
   - Execute the SQL queries 

## Troubleshooting
Double-check your database connection settings in the SQL client tool to ensure they match your database configuration
